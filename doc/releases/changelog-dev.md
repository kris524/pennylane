# Release 0.25.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

* Added the new optimizer, `qml.SPSAOptimizer` that implements the simultaneous
  perturbation stochastic approximation method based on
  [An Overview of the Simultaneous Perturbation Method for Efficient Optimization](https://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA/PDF-SPSA/Spall_An_Overview.PDF).
  [(#2661)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2661)

  It is a suitable optimizer for cost functions whose evaluation may involve
  noise, as optimization with SPSA may significantly decrease the number of
  quantum executions for the entire optimization.

  ```pycon
  >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=1)
  >>> def circuit(params):
  ...     qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)
  ...     qml.RY(params[1], wires=0)
  >>> coeffs = [1, 1]
  >>> obs = [qml.PauliX(0), qml.PauliZ(0)]
  >>> H = qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs, obs)
  >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
  ... def cost(params):
  ...     circuit(params)
  ...     return qml.expval(H)
  >>> params = np.random.normal(0, np.pi, (2), requires_grad=True)
  >>> print(params)
  [-5.92774911 -4.26420843]
  >>> print(cost(params))
  0.43866366253270167
  >>> max_iterations = 50
  >>> opt = qml.SPSAOptimizer(maxiter=max_iterations)
  >>> for _ in range(max_iterations):
  ...     params, energy = opt.step_and_cost(cost, params)
  >>> print(params)
  [-6.21193761 -2.99360548]
  >>> print(energy)
  -1.1258709813834058
  ```

* New PennyLane-inspired `sketch` and `sketch_dark` styles are now available for drawing circuit diagram graphics.
  [(#2709)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2709)

* Added operation `qml.QutritUnitary` for applying user-specified unitary operations on qutrit devices.
  [(#2699)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2699)  

<h3>Improvements</h3>
  
* Samples can be grouped into counts by passing the `counts=True` flag to `qml.sample`.
  [(#2686)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2686)
  
  Note that the change included creating a new `Counts` measurement type in `measurements.py`.

  `counts=True` can be set when obtaining raw samples in the computational basis:
  
  ```pycon
  >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2, shots=1000)
  >>>
  >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
  >>> def circuit():
  ...     qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
  ...     qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
  ...     # passing the counts flag
  ...     return qml.sample(counts=True)   
  >>> result = circuit()
  >>> print(result)
  {'00': 495, '11': 505}
  ```
  
  Counts can also be obtained when sampling the eigenstates of an observable:
  
  ```pycon
  >>> dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2, shots=1000)
  >>>
  >>> @qml.qnode(dev)
  >>> def circuit():
  ...   qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
  ...   qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
  ...   return qml.sample(qml.PauliZ(0), counts=True), qml.sample(qml.PauliZ(1), counts=True)
  >>> result = circuit()
  >>> print(result)
  [tensor({-1: 526, 1: 474}, dtype=object, requires_grad=True)
   tensor({-1: 526, 1: 474}, dtype=object, requires_grad=True)]
  ```

* The `qml.state` and `qml.density_matrix` measurements now support custom wire
  labels.
  [(#2779)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2779)

* Adds a new function to compare operators. `qml.equal` can be used to compare equality of parametric operators taking into account their interfaces and trainability.
  [(#2651)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2651)

* The `default.mixed` device now supports backpropagation with the `"jax"` interface.
  [(#2754)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2754)

* Quantum channels such as `qml.BitFlip` now support abstract tensors. This allows
  their usage inside QNodes decorated by `tf.function`, `jax.jit`, or `jax.vmap`:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device("default.mixed", wires=1)

  @qml.qnode(dev, diff_method="backprop", interface="jax")
  def circuit(t):
      qml.PauliX(wires=0)
      qml.ThermalRelaxationError(0.1, t, 1.4, 0.1, wires=0)
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))
  ```
  ```pycon
  >>> x = jnp.array([0.8, 1.0, 1.2])
  >>> jax.vmap(circuit)(x)
  DeviceArray([-0.78849435, -0.8287073 , -0.85608006], dtype=float32)
  ```

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

* PennyLane now depends on newer versions (>=2.7) of the `semantic_version` package,
  which provides an updated API that is incompatible which versions of the package prior to 2.7.
  If you run into issues relating to this package, please reinstall PennyLane.

  [(#2767)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2767)

<h3>Deprecations</h3>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

* Optimization examples of using JAXopt and Optax with the JAX interface have
  been added.
  [(#2769)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2769)

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

* `qml.grouping.group_observables` now works when individual wire
  labels are iterable.
  [(#2752)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/2752)

* The adjoint of an adjoint has a correct `expand` result.
